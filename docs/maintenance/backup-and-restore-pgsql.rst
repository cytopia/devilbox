Backup and restore PostgreSQL
*****************************

Backup and restore will be necessary when you are going to switch PostgreSQL versions.
Each version has its own data directory and is fully indepentend of other versions.
In case you want to switch to a different version, but still want to have your PostgreSQL databases
present, you must first backup the databases of your current version and import them into the
new version.

There are multiple ways to backup and restore. Chose the one which is most convenient for you.
