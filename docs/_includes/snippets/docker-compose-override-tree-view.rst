The Devilbox ships various example configurations to overwrite the default stack. Those files are
located under ``compose/`` in the Devilbox git directory.

``docker-compose.override.yml-all`` has all examples combined in one file for easy copy/paste.
However, each example also exists in its standalone file as shown below:
