******************
Start the Devilbox
******************

Congratulations, when you have reached this page everything has been set up and you can now get
your hands dirty.

.. note::

   Starting and stopping containers is done via ``docker-compose``. If you have never worked with
   it before, have a look at their documentation for
   |ext_lnk_docker_compose_cmd_overview|, |ext_lnk_docker_compose_cmd_up|,
   |ext_lnk_docker_compose_cmd_stop|, |ext_lnk_docker_compose_cmd_kill|,
   |ext_lnk_docker_compose_cmd_rm|, |ext_lnk_docker_compose_cmd_logs| and
   |ext_lnk_docker_compose_cmd_pull| commands.

The Devilbox startup explained
==============================

To gain a brief understanding about what is happening under the hood during startup,
read ahead or skip directly to: :ref:`start_the_devilbox_start_all_container`.


Startup operations with the same configuration are idempotent, thus consecutive startups will not
introduce any new changes. The following shows the brief startup steps:

* Docker Compose will automatically pull all necessary Docker images if they do not
  exist locally.
* Once the HTTPD container start, it will automatically create a Certificate Authority to be used
  for https connections and will place it in the ``ca/`` directory.
* The HTTPD container will then look for already available projects and create virtual hosts
  configurations, apply vhost-gen templates as well as CA-signed HTTPS certificates.
* Once the Bind container start, it will create a wildcard DNS zone for the given
  :ref:`env_tld_suffix`
* In case MySQL or PgSQL container start, they will populate itself with their required default
  databases.

.. note::
   Docker images are only pulled if they do not exist. They are not updated automatically.
   If you want to update to new Docker images read on: :ref:`update_the_devilbox`.


.. _start_the_devilbox_start_all_container:

Start all container
===================

If you want all provided docker container to be available (as defined in ``docker-compose.yml``),
start them all by not explicitly specifying any image name.

Foreground
----------

For the first startup, foreground start is recommended to see any errors that might occur:

.. code-block:: bash

   host> docker-compose up

* If you want to gracefully stop all container, hit ``Ctrl + c``
* If you want to kill all container, hit ``Ctrl + c`` twice
* Ensure to run ``docker-compose rm -f`` afterwards

Background
----------

For consecutive startups you can send them into background (``-d``):

.. code-block:: bash

   host> docker-compose up -d

* If you want to gracefully stop all container, enter ``docker-compose stop``
* If you want to kill all container, enter ``docker-compose kill``
* Ensure to run ``docker-compose rm -f`` afterwards


Start some container
====================

If you don't require all container to be up and running and let's say just ``PHP``, ``HTTPD`` and
``MYSQL``, you must explicitly specify the image names to start:

Foreground
----------

.. code-block:: bash

   host> docker-compose up httpd php mysql

* If you want to gracefully stop all started container, hit ``Ctrl + c``
* If you want to kill all started container, hit ``Ctrl + c`` twice
* Ensure to run ``docker-compose rm -f`` afterwards

Background
----------

.. code-block:: bash

   host> docker-compose up -d httpd php mysql

* If you want to gracefully stop all container, enter ``docker-compose stop``
* If you want to kill all container, enter ``docker-compose kill``
* Ensure to run ``docker-compose rm -f`` afterwards

      Have a look at this page to get an overview about all available container and by what name
      they have to be specified.


.. _start_the_devilbox_stop_and_restart:

Stop and Restart
================

.. important::

   When stopping or restarting the Devilbox, ensure to also **remove stopped container** before the
   next startup to prevent orphaned runtime settings and always start fresh.

   This will prevent many common Docker issues.

.. seealso:: **Troubleshooting:** :ref:`troubleshooting_what_to_do_first`


Stop all container
------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # Stop all container
   host> docker-compose stop
   # Remove stopped container (important!)
   host> docker-compose rm -f

Restart all container
---------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   # Stop all container
   host> docker-compose stop
   # Remove stopped container (important!)
   host> docker-compose rm -f
   # Start all container
   host> docker-compose up


Open Devilbox intranet
======================

Once ``docker-compose up`` has finished and all or the selected container are up and running,
you can visit the Devilbox intranet with your favorite Web browser at http://localhost or
http://127.0.0.1 (https://localhost or https://127.0.0.1 respectively).

The Intranet start page will also show you all running and failed containers:


.. include:: /_includes/figures/devilbox/devilbox-intranet-dash-all.rst
.. include:: /_includes/figures/devilbox/devilbox-intranet-dash-selective.rst

.. important::
   :ref:`howto_find_docker_toolbox_ip_address`
      When you are using ``Docker Toolbox`` the Devilbox web server port will not be available on
      your host computer. You first have to find out on which IP address the Docker Toolbox machine
      is serving and use this one instead.


Checklist
=========

1. Docker container are started successfully with ``docker-compose up``
2. ``docker-compose rm -f`` is issued before restarting the Devilbox
3. Intranet is reachable via ``http://localhost``, ``http://127.0.0.1`` or Docker Toolbox IP address
4. Intranet is reachable via ``https://localhost``, ``https://127.0.0.1`` (HTTPS)
