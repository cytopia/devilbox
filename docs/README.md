## 1. Main idea

The devilbox allows you to have an unlimited number of projects ready without having to install any external software and without having to configure any virtual hosts. As well as providing a very flexible development stack that you can run offline. (Internet is only required to initially pull docker container).

The only thing you will have to do is to create a new folder on the filesystem and your virtual host is ready to be served with your custom domain.

The default project catch-all domain is `*.loc` (see [Configure](Configure.md) for how to change it). Let's view an example:

```shell
# Inside your main project folder
$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x 3 cytopia 4096 Jun 10 13:10 my-drupal
drwxr-xr-x 3 cytopia 4096 Jun 10 13:10 my-wordpress
drwxr-xr-x 3 cytopia 4096 Jun 10 13:10 project1
drwxr-xr-x 3 cytopia 4096 Jun 10 13:10 project2
drwxr-xr-x 3 cytopia 4096 Jun 10 13:10 yii-test
```

By having the above folders, the devilbox will automatically be able to serve the following vhosts:

* http://my-drupal.loc
* http://my-wordpress.loc
* http://project1.loc
* http://project2.loc
* http://yii-test.loc

New folders can be created, deleted and removed during run-time and corresponding virtual hosts will be available instantly without having to restart anything.


## 2. Features

| Feature | Description |

| **Run** | |
| Selective start | Run only the Docker container you actually need. |
| Version choice  | Use your development stack with whatever version combination needed. |
| Stack choice  | Attach SQL or NoSQL container and use Nginx or Apache to simulate your live env. |

## 3. Supported Host OS

The devilbox runs on all major operating systems. Below you can quickly check the recommended docker versions and current issues per OS.

**How about FreeBSD?**

The devilbox has not been tested on FreeBSD yet. Current milestones include to make it rock-solid on the above listed operating systems. However, if you want it to run on FreeBSD open up an issue on Github and you will receive support making it work on FreeBSD.


## 4. Requirements

* **Internet connection** - only required during initial setup for cloning the devilbox repository and pulling the required docker container. Afterwards you can always work offline.
* [Docker Engine 1.12.0+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-21)
* [Docker Compose 1.9.0+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/#version-21)
* On Windows use [Docker for Windows][d4w] (not tested on [Docker Toolbox][dtb])
* On OSX use [Docker for Mac][d4m] (not tested on [Docker Toolbox][dtb])


## 5. Docker documentation

If you have never worked with docker/docker-compose before, you should check up on their documentation to get you started: [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/).

## 7. Video Tutorials

Have a look at youtube to see some the features in action.

## 8. Available PHP Modules

The devilbox is a development stack, so it is made sure that a lot of PHP modules are available out of the box in order to work with many different frameworks.

> *apc, apcu, bcmath, bz2, calendar, Core, ctype, curl, date, dom, ereg, exif, fileinfo, filter, ftp, gd, gettext, gmp, hash, iconv, igbinary, imagick, imap, intl, json, ldap, libxml, magickwand, mbstring, mcrypt, memcache, memcached, mhash, mongodb, msgpack, mysql, mysqli, mysqlnd, openssl, pcntl, pcre, PDO, pdo_mysql, pdo_pgsql, pdo_sqlite, pgsql, phalcon, Phar, posix, pspell, readline, recode, redis, Reflection, session, shmop, SimpleXML, soap, sockets, SPL, sqlite3, standard, sysvmsg, sysvsem, sysvshm, tidy, tokenizer, uploadprogress, wddx, xdebug, xml, xmlreader, xmlrpc, xmlwriter, xsl, Zend OPcache, zip, zlib*

There will however be slight differences between the versions and especially with HHVM. To see the exact bundled modules for each version visit the corresponding docker repositories on Github:

[PHP 5.4](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm-5.4) |
[PHP 5.5](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm-5.5) |
[PHP 5.6](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm-5.6) |
[PHP 7.0](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm-7.0) |
[PHP 7.1](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm-7.1) |
[PHP 7.2](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm-7.2) |
[PHP 7.3](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-php-fpm-7.3) |
[HHVM](https://github.com/devilbox/docker-hhvm-latest)

** Custom PHP Modules**

Apart from asking for new modules to be bundled with each Docker container, you can simply also just place any missing modules into `mod/(php-fpm|hhvm)-<VERSION>` and add a custom `*.ini` file to load them. See [Custom PHP Modules](Configure.md#425-custom-php-modules) in the Configuration documentation for how to do that in two simple steps.

## 9. Supported Frameworks and CMS

As far as tested there are no limitations and you can use any Framework or CMS just as you would on your live environment. Below are a few examples of extensively tested Frameworks and CMS:

[![CakePHP](img/logo_fw/cake.png)](https://cakephp.org)
[![Drupal](img/logo_fw/drupal.png)](https://www.drupal.org)
[![Laravel](img/logo_fw/laravel.png)](https://laravel.com)
[![Phalcon](img/logo_fw/phalcon.png)](https://phalconphp.com)
[![Symfony](img/logo_fw/symfony.png)](https://symfony.com)
[![Wordpress](img/logo_fw/wordpress.png)](https://wordpress.org)
[![Yii](img/logo_fw/yii.png)](http://www.yiiframework.com)
[![Zend](img/logo_fw/zend.png)](https://framework.zend.com)

Have a look at **[Examples](Examples.md)** for how to set them up on the devilbox.
