Find some useful information and tips for the documentation itself.

Shell commands
==============

.. important::

   All shell commands in this documentation use two different formats:

   1. This one indicates that the command should be executed on your host operating system. (When copying commands, do not copy the ``host>`` part).

   .. code-block:: bash

      host> command

   2. This one indicates that the command should be executed inside the currently selected PHP container.  (When copying commands, do not copy the ``php>`` part).

   .. code-block:: bash

      php> command


Checklists
==========

.. note::
   Most guids and tutorials provide a **Checklist** at the very bottom.
   You can as well jump to it and quickly see if you have done everything already.


Where to start?
===============

On the left menu you will find a ``GETTING STARTED`` section, **read through all of them** to get
a basic theoretical and practical understanding about the Devilbox.

There is also a :ref:`blogs_videos_and_use_cases` section that might be useful as an additional crash-course.
