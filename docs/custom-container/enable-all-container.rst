Enable all additional container

intranet, the Devilbox also ships additional pre-configured container that can easily be enabled.

Enable all additional container
===============================

Copy ``docker-compose.override.yml-all`` into the root of the Devilbox git directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   host> cp compose/docker-compose.override.yml-all docker-compose.override.yml

That's it, if you ``docker-compose up``, all container will be started. This however is not
adviced as it will eat up a lot of resources. You are better off by selectively specifying the
container you want to run.
