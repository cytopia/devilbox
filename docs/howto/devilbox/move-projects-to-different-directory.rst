**************************************
Move projects to a different directory
**************************************

No matter if your projects are already in a different location or if you want to move them out of
the Devilbox git directory now, you can do that in a few simple steps.

Projects in an absolute path
============================

So letâ€™s assume all of your projects are already in place under ``/home/user/workspace/web/``.
Now you decide to use the Devilbox, but still want to keep your projects where they are at the
moment.

All you have to do is to adjust the path of :ref:`env_httpd_datadir` in the ``.env`` file.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Navigate to Devilbox git directory
   host> cd path/to/devilbox

   # Open the .env file with your favourite editor
   host> vim .env

Now Adjust the value of :ref:`env_httpd_datadir`

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: .env
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   HOST_PATH_HTTPD_DATADIR=/home/user/workspace/web

That's it, whenever you start up the Devilbox, ``/home/user/workspace/web/`` will be mounted into
the PHP and the web server container into ``/shared/httpd/``.


Projects adjacent to Devilbox directory
=======================================

Consider the following directory setup:

.. code-block:: bash

   |
   +- devilbox/
   |
   +- projects/
      |
      + project1/
      | |
      | + htdocs/
      |
      + project2/
        |
        + htdocs/

Independently of where the Devilbox directory is located, you can achieve this structure via
relative path settings.

All you have to to is to adjust the path of :ref:`env_httpd_datadir` in the ``.env`` file.

.. code-block:: bash

   # Navigate to Devilbox git directory
   host> cd path/to/devilbox

   # Open the .env file with your favourite editor
   host> vim .env

Now Adjust the value of :ref:`env_httpd_datadir`

.. code-block:: bash
   :caption: .env
   :emphasize-lines: 1

   HOST_PATH_HTTPD_DATADIR=../projects

That's it, whenever you start up the Devilbox, your project directory will be mounted into
the PHP and the web server container into ``/shared/httpd/``.
