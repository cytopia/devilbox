Virtual host vs Reverse Proxy

Motivation
==========

By default, all virtual hosts will simply serve files located in your document root directory within
your project directory. Sometimes however your *project* is already its own server that will serve
requests through a listening network port. (e.g. a running NodeJS application).
This listening port will however only be available inside the PHP container (or any other container)
you have added to the Devilbox and the webserver is not aware of this.

For this kind of project you will want to create a reverse proxy which simply forwards the requests
incoming to the webserver to your application (either to the PHP container to a specific port or
to any other container you have attached).


Benefits
========

By using the already available web server to reverse proxy requests to your service you will be
able to have all the current features for you application such as:

* Have it displayed in the intranet page
* Have standardized domain names
* Have valid HTTPS


Creating a reverse proxy
========================

Creating a reverse proxy is as simply as copying the ``vhost-gen`` templates to your project
directory.

In order to make your life simple there are a few generic docs that get you started and let you
know more about the theory behind it:

.. seealso::

   * :ref:`reverse_proxy_with_https`
   * :ref:`reverse_proxy_with_custom_docker`

If this is too generic you can also have a look at two specific examples to setup fully automated
Reverse Proxies including autostarting your application on ``docker-compose up``.
