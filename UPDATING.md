## Update from `v0.x.y` to `v1.x.y`

#### Docker Volumes

**PR:** https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox/pull/383

This feature will move all data directories (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and others) to Docker
volumes for best-practice and compatibility reasons on different operating systems.

Before updating to this release, you will need to manually trigger a backup of MySQL,
PostgreSQL and MongoDB to ensure that you have a copy of your data. By switching to this release
you will be unable to access your current data:

**Steps to update:**

1. Backup your data
2. Switch to the new release
3. Import your data
