About the phpPgAdmin Report Plugin
----------------------------------

The Report plugin is the old report feature of phpPgAdmins removed in 
version 5.1 and refactored as a plugin.

It enables you to create and save ad-hoc SQL queries as reports which
can be easily be executed from within phpPgAdmin.

To save reports, this plugin requires the creation of a dedicated
database containing a single table; see the INSTALL file and the
sql/reports.sql file for details.

Following installation, an icon for the Report plugin will appear 
on the main overview page for each connected server. This provides
an overview of all reports saved for the entire server, and enables
executionm, editing and deletion of reports, as well as creation of 
new reports from scratch.

New reports can also be created while browsing table and view data,
a "create report" link is provided at the bottom of each data page
which pre-populates the report with the SQL used to generate the 
data.
