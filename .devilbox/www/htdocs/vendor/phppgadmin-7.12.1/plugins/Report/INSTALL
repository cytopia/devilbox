phpPgAdmin Report Plugin Installation Guide
-------------------------------------------
1. Report Plugin activation

   Open conf/config.inc.php and add the 'Report' value in the $conf['plugins'] array:

   $conf['plugins'] = array('Report');

2. Set up the reports database.

   If you want to enable reports (which are a useful feature) then go to
   the 'sql' subdirectory and view the SQL script for your database.  It
   will contain instructions on how to set up the reports database.
