Git lib for Gitonomy
====================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gitonomy/gitlib.png)](https://travis-ci.org/gitonomy/gitlib)

This library provides methods to access Git repository from PHP.

It makes shell calls, which makes it less performant than any solution.

Anyway, it's convenient and don't need to build anything to use it. That's how we love it.
